Map exploring the history of the roman republic &amp; empire
My often neglected personal project inspired by the fantastic series The History of Rome by Mike Duncan.
The concept is for a topographic base map you can explore by year and see relevent events and political boundaries.
Concepts to Implement:
* Topographic basemap
* Political boundaries as overlays
* Point events
* Citation methods
* Extended events (lasting longer that 1yr)
* Easy email sign-up / passcode login
* User submission for new or inaccurate events
